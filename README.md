# Fate Core App

A toy project for managing Fate Core Aspects.

Fate Core is a TTRPG system designed for full creative flexibility and minimal number-crunching; to that end, it utilizes Aspects, phrases that describe what's happening in-game. Managing these Aspects can be a chore, which is why this program has been created to help streamline the process. Currently still in early beta.

Utilizes React, ASP.NET, and PostgreSQL.
